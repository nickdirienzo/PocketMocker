# PocketMocker

## Description
PocketMocker is a system that allows Android users more control of their data through realistic mocked data. PocketMocker consists of modifications to the Android platform (see `platform_changes` for details), and a userlevel app (see `app` for details).

This is a basic prototype that implements record-and-replay sensor mocking, and was able to successfully trick Waze, Facebook, and Fast Racing 3D.
